🕒 Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to perform time series forecasting. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are well-suited for modeling sequential data and making predictions based on time-dependent features.

📈 Objective
To forecast future values in a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data, energy consumption) using an LSTM-based deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

🛠️ Features
Data preprocessing for time series modeling

Sequence generation for LSTM input

LSTM model architecture

Model training and evaluation

Forecast visualization

Support for multi-step forecasting
